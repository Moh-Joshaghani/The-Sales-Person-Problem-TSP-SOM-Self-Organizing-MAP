# The Sales Person (TSP) problem 
## By Mohammad Joshaghani

This project implements SOM (self-organized map) clustering algorithm aimed to solve the TSP problem. Implementation is performed in both Matlab and Python


## Getting Started

To use the codes, use the following command:
`git clone https://github.com/mhDd/The-Sales-Person-Problem-TSP-.git`



## Running the Python implementation
To run, simply run the main.py file. 

### output
